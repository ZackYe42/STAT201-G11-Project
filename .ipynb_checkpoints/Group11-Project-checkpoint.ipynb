    "Air pollution is one of the leading causes of a number of adverse health problems. Measuring air quality in urban areas is important for regulating outdoor activities and preserving a healthy lifestyle. Air quality is measured through different sensors that detect pollutants and particles in the air. Based on this detection, the air quality is placed on an AQI that ranges from 0-500, or “good” to “hazardous” air quality (Lemeš, 2018) . On a daily basis, the air quality varies with a surge in activities that induce more air pollution, such as intense traffic during rush hour (Trozzi et al., 1999). \n",
    "\n",
    "This begs us to ask the question: **How do the summarized sensor response used to determine air quality index differ between mornings and nights in an Italian city from 2004 to 2005?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For our research, we are using the dataset <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality\">Air Quality</a> from the UCI machine learning repository, which we have stored in a separate GitHub repository. It contains responses to gas and particle sensors placed in a highly polluted area of an Italian city. This data was collected from 2004-2005 and depicts 9348 observations of hourly averaged concentrations of different chemical air pollutants at that point in time. For the purpose of our research, we are taking the readings from the first month and removing cases with missing data. Our variables of interest are the ```date```, ```time```, and the hourly averaged sensor response columns of ``` PT08.S1``` targetting carbon monoxide, ```PT08.S2``` targetting non-metallic hydrocarbons, ``` PT08.S3``` targetting NO<sub>x</sub> , ```PT08.S4``` targetting NO<sub>2</sub>, and ```PT08.S5``` targetting O<sub>3</sub>."

    "Our report can be considered trustworthy as it is diligently pre-processed from a reputable dataset from the UCI machine learning repository, with any missing entries removed to ensure reliable results presented as insightful plots and estimates. However, this may not be sufficient for stakeholders who require more rigorous evidence. So, we aim to complement the plots with hypothesis testing and confidence intervals to make inferences about the population parameters with a certain level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will conduct a **hypothesis test** to compare the average sensor response between mornings and nights. The null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) would be that there is no significant difference in the mean sensor response during mornings and nights, while the alternative hypothesis (H<sub>A</sub>) would be that a significant difference exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also construct **confidence intervals** (using a confidence level of 95%) for the mean sensor response during mornings and nights separately, to obtain a range of plausible values for the population mean, providing a measure of uncertainty around our estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that, on average, the air quality is worse in the mornings. Based on previous research on the topic, the highest concentrations of different pollutants occur in the morning, likely due to traffic density, road dust or temperature inversions (Chen et al., 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "The finding of this research could have significant implications for urban planning and public health policies.\n",
    "City authorities and environmental agencies can use this information to implement targeted interventions during specific times of the day to improve air quality and protect public health.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could lead to further research on the long term health effects of exposure to poor air quality in cities: how does consistent exposure to poor air quality affect one’s long term health? Additionally, it may be interesting to explore the relationship between air quality and specific sources of pollution, such as vehicular emissions or industrial activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this comprehensive report aims to shed light on the average air quality in an Italian city during mornings and nights. By incorporating hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, we can provide more robust evidence to stakeholders, facilitating informed decision-making and potential policy changes for a healthier urban environment. The research findings could lead to further investigations and have a positive impact on public health and environmental management in the long run."
